My personal projects to study machine learning, data analysis, big data.

weather_GISTEMP.py
    plotted a simple prediction model showing a 4 degree rise of global 
    temperature by 2100, using GISS database by Nasa. Scientists predict 
    3-5 degrees by 2100. Yearly graph.
    
weather_GISTEMP_monthly.py
    same as above but instead reading from monthly weather data.
